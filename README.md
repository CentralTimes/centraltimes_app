This is the repository of the official app for the award-winning Central Times high school newspaper.

as a backend, which includes [some modifications](https://github.com/CentralTimes/wp_ct_rest_api) to
provide support for [SNO FLEX](https://snosites.com/benefits/)
, [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/), and other custom site and app
configuration metadata.
